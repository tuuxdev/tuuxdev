							<h2>GRUPO SANCHO CASE STUDY</h2>
							<p class="mb2">Being the largest advertising and marketing company in Colombia and one of the biggest in

							<p>For +2 years I was part of the team that took on the challenge and designed the required solutions.
							</p>

							<p class="pb3"> Initially I joined the team as a UX Designer in charge of carrying out the user research

								the
								HTML / CSS / JS Front-end as well.</p>

						<h3>The company</h3>
						<p> The largest advertising and marketing holding in Colombia and one of the largest in the world. It has
							more
							than 1000 employees in around 8 agencies present in the business of creativity and media management
							throughout
							the country.</p>
					</div>

					<div lass="pl3">
						<h3>The challenge</h3>
						<p> Be part of the technology team responsible for designing and developing a unified software solution in
							which
							all the functionalities required by the company at an operational, administrative and financial level
							(ERP)
							will be grouped.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h3> Goals</h3>
				<p> When I joined the team, the first thing I did was a socialization process with stakeholders about the
					objectives of the project in the near, medium and long term, in which the need to unify the software tools
					used at that moment by the different areas of the company in a single software across the entire organization
					(ERP) as the main objective to achieve, taking in mind that in the long term the idea of being able to market
					the software in other organizations and countries could be a real possibility.</p>

				<p> Having defined the main objective, I was able to determine that the understanding of the business would be
					fundamental to the creation process as well as the definition of the pain points and needs of the users with
					respect to the software they used at that time.</p>

				<p> Once defined the requirements of the users and with the knowledge of the assimilated business could begin a
					face of more solid creation.</p>

				<h3> First Research</h3>

				<p> For the understanding of the business several sessions of interviews with who was my direct manager (Someone
					with more than 10 years of experience working in the organization) were of great value. I have taught myself
					to understand how the business of each of the agencies worked and the software needs that had been determined
					during those years should be met. At the same time several interviews with users and some surveys gave us the
					expected results on the perception of users. Low application performance, complicated flows and a confusing
					information architecture were several of the painful points that we managed to determine.</p>

				<p> During this phase we started to raise information about the new requirements that were not covered in the
					current applications.</p>

				<h3>Synthesis and hypothesis</h3>

				<p> With the information gathered in the face of research, I began to create different artifacts that allow the
					team to visualize the findings. The creation of a user Person with well-defined pain points was the first task
					fulfilled. With a site Map of the first face of the product and a User Flow of the first functionality of that
					face we began to create the wireframes of each screen to complete an interactive prototype that was the result
					that we validated with users and stakeholders to make adjustments and then move on to development.</p>

				<p> The process was well received by all parties and allowed to improve the perceived quality of the delivered
					product, so we decided to iterate on these same steps for the design and development of the following
					functionalities.</p>

				<h3>Need for the design system</h3>

				<p> As we were going through the design process and the app functionalities increased, we began to identify a
					series of inconsistencies in the interface that were generating evident usability problems. The developers
					were writing a non recursive code and the final product on many occasions distanced strongly from the defined
					design generating inconsistency of use, so we decided to create a design system for the ERP that was a common
					language and a unique source of truth for designers and developers.</p>

				<p> We start by creating an inventory of all the existing components in the application until then, then
					categorize them into atoms, molecules, components and layouts. We made a checklist of colors and typographies
					and we also identify the context of use of each part of the system.</p>

				<p> Once we had the inventory we started creating the libraries for the design team in such a way that each
					member could design the mockups and prototypes in coherence with the rest of the team and the application.
					With the defined libraries, the same components were materialized in HTML / CSS / JS code so that when passing
					the prototypes to development, the team will have exactly the same components available for its real and
					functional implementation.</p>

				<p> Finally this part of the project culminated with the documentation of the entire system and the disclosure
					of the manual throughout the team.</p>

				<h3> Result</h3>

				<p> My time in the Group was two years of continuous growth. The users perceived a big change between the past
					applications and the new ERP. The productivity of the company had a palpable increase and we know that part of
					the fault was the software we designed, although it was never a fully finished product due to its continuous
					growth and new requirements, it always allowed us to interact with the users and have the opportunity to
					improve in each release.</p>
