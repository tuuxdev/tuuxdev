						<h3>The company</h3>
						<p> One of the biggest drink manufacturer in Colombia and in the world with hundred of consumers and
							employees and present all around the world.</p>
					</div>

					<div lass="pl3">
						<h3>The challenge</h3>
						<p> Understand the company requirements, constrains and hypothesis and verify if people need and want what
							stakeholders assume they need and want.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h3>Goal</h3>
				<p>Build a responsive web app that allowed us to collect enough data that serveded the company to decide if
					there
					exists a real opportunity to gave people a useful service to them.
				</p>

				<h3>The process</h3>
				<p>The team was framed in an Agile framework with two weeks sprints. The design cell started the research to
					define the features that must been into the product and the service required to accomplish the user's goals.
					Then, we turned the research results into user flows that served as a resource to design the wireframes that
					were socialized with the product owner and the stakeholders. Depending the impact of each feature the
					wireframe was tested or not in a laboratory usability test sessions with users.</p>

				<p>After the approval of the PO, the wireframes were turned into a high fidelity mockup that was validated with
					stakeholders again an if the feature had not been tested in that point we executed a laboratory, remote or
					guerrilla usability test. With the findings of the test we improved the designed interface and finally
					delivered the mockups with the design specs to the developers' team. They did their magic and turn the design
					into a real functional product and finally, the QA area made their job to stay sure that the release was as
					expected.</p>
				<h3>Initial Approach</h3>
				<p>I joined the team in the sprint 1 with the goal to had the MVP fulled released on sprint 5. The design
					thinker had been some research with the stakeholder. With the help of some qualitative data collected before
					the creation of the squad, she did a blueprint of the service and taking the base of the blueprint we started
					to think the customer journey defining the touchpoints, feelings, user actions and risks of each stage of the
					service.</p>

				<p>After the customer journey creation, we started creating some paper prototypes and concept board to test the
					prime hypothesis with people on the streets. Then we executed some interviews with friends and family and
					finally, we synthesized the insights to retouched the customer journey and developed the first user persona.
				</p>

				<h3>Thinking and designing the product</h3>

				<p>With a big picture of the service, we started to draft the screens needed to develop the app. Focused on each
					step of the users in the purchase stage of the journey and with the constraints of stakeholder, we decided to
					implement a flow without login or registration to reduce friction and obtain the more data possible to test
					the core of the idea so we made a step by step flow with the main features of an e-commerce</p>

				<p>Once we had the flow we made some first sketches for the main screens that were the starter point of the
					digital job.</p>

				<p>The digital wireframe was socialized with the stakeholder and after they approve the concept, the UI design
					began. The UI designer and I decide to not start with a complete design system due to the MVP character and
					the team size, but instead, we design a shared components library that served as our system.</p>

				<p>When the high fidelity mockups were done we made a detailed interactive prototype and executed 3 sessions of
					a laboratory usability test.</p>

				<p>The results were diverse. The flow of the app worked as expected but some micro-interactions generated
					friction with the users to complete their tasks so we decided to made changes in some components, especially
					in forms screens.</p>

				<p>The refined mockup was passed to the developers for the construction of the functional product and once it
					was done and the QA gave us the approve with test the product in several laboratory and guerrilla tests.</p>

				<p>Some findings were detected when users interacted with the app with no native components, especially on the
					mobile version so some changes where required directly on the code of the functional product.</p>

				<h3>The Result</h3>

				<p>At the end of the iteration of the 5 sprints, we release the product with all the features we decided based
					on the initial research were the most important to the users to find the product helpful and that provide us
					the necessary data to make a decision about the viability of the idea.</p>

				<p>While the MVP was live the team began with the research and ideation phase to put the MVP on a neighbor
					country.</p>

						<h3>The company</h3>
						<p> The largest advertising and marketing holding in Colombia and one of the largest in the world. It has
							more
							than 1000 employees in around 8 agencies present in the business of creativity and media management
							throughout
							the country.</p>
					</div>

					<div lass="pl3">
						<h3>The challenge</h3>
						<p> Be part of the technology team responsible for designing and developing a unified software solution in
							which
							all the functionalities required by the company at an operational, administrative and financial level
							(ERP)
							will be grouped.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h3> Goals</h3>
				<p> When I joined the team, the first thing I did was a socialization process with stakeholders about the
					objectives of the project in the near, medium and long term, in which the need to unify the software tools
					used at that moment by the different areas of the company in a single software across the entire organization
					(ERP) as the main objective to achieve, taking in mind that in the long term the idea of being able to market
					the software in other organizations and countries could be a real possibility.</p>

				<p> Having defined the main objective, I was able to determine that the understanding of the business would be
					fundamental to the creation process as well as the definition of the pain points and needs of the users with
					respect to the software they used at that time.</p>

				<p> Once defined the requirements of the users and with the knowledge of the assimilated business could begin a
					face of more solid creation.</p>

				<h3> First Research</h3>

				<p> For the understanding of the business several sessions of interviews with who was my direct manager (Someone
					with more than 10 years of experience working in the organization) were of great value. I have taught myself
					to understand how the business of each of the agencies worked and the software needs that had been determined
					during those years should be met. At the same time several interviews with users and some surveys gave us the
					expected results on the perception of users. Low application performance, complicated flows and a confusing
					information architecture were several of the painful points that we managed to determine.</p>

				<p> During this phase we started to raise information about the new requirements that were not covered in the
					current applications.</p>

				<h3>Synthesis and hypothesis</h3>

				<p> With the information gathered in the face of research, I began to create different artifacts that allow the
					team to visualize the findings. The creation of a user Person with well-defined pain points was the first task
					fulfilled. With a site Map of the first face of the product and a User Flow of the first functionality of that
					face we began to create the wireframes of each screen to complete an interactive prototype that was the result
					that we validated with users and stakeholders to make adjustments and then move on to development.</p>

				<p> The process was well received by all parties and allowed to improve the perceived quality of the delivered
					product, so we decided to iterate on these same steps for the design and development of the following
					functionalities.</p>

				<h3>Need for the design system</h3>

				<p> As we were going through the design process and the app functionalities increased, we began to identify a
					series of inconsistencies in the interface that were generating evident usability problems. The developers
					were writing a non recursive code and the final product on many occasions distanced strongly from the defined
					design generating inconsistency of use, so we decided to create a design system for the ERP that was a common
					language and a unique source of truth for designers and developers.</p>

				<p> We start by creating an inventory of all the existing components in the application until then, then
					categorize them into atoms, molecules, components and layouts. We made a checklist of colors and typographies
					and we also identify the context of use of each part of the system.</p>

				<p>Once we had the inventory we started creating the libraries for the design team in such a way that each
					member could design the mockups and prototypes in coherence with the rest of the team and the application.
					With the defined libraries, the same components were materialized in HTML / CSS / JS code so that when passing
					the prototypes to development, the team will have exactly the same components available for its real and
					functional implementation.</p>

				<p> Finally this part of the project culminated with the documentation of the entire system and the disclosure
					of the manual throughout the team.</p>

				<h3> Result</h3>

				<p> My time in the Group was two years of continuous growth. The users perceived a big change between the past
					applications and the new ERP. The productivity of the company had a palpable increase and we know that part of
					the fault was the software we designed, although it was never a fully finished product due to its continuous
					growth and new requirements, it always allowed us to interact with the users and have the opportunity to
					improve in each release.</p>
